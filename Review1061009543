-The maxim subsequence problem pg 37
4 algorithms to solve this problem
1. iterate thorugh all possibities.
O(n^3)
2.less loops pg 39 book. O(n^2)
3. use divide and conquer technique pg 41 O(NlogN)
4.single run on data execute in O(n) time

-The GCD problem
eclides algorithm determines GCD pg 45 is 1.44 LogN

-The find Exp. Problem
find exponential is 2logN not N if done corrent pg 46.
