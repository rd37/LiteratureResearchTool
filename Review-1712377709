Splitstream presents a tree-based message multicasting 
implementation to take adavantage of peer to peer processing 
environment.  the key challenge overcome is in the disjoint tree
set construction and maintenance.  As well, since some peers
have bandwidth restrictions, this needs to be taken into account.

Excellent paper and provides good insight to providing 
high bandwidth content distribution in an efficient manner.
