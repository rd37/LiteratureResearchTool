The paper proposes a framework which can integrate
agreements with SOA crowd computing platforms.  The addition 
they provide is the ability to monitor infrastructure which can 
update the resource model.    Effictively providing adaptive
assignment of crowd resources to meet client demands.

The key challeges addressed in order to support the negotiation
of client needs to available crowd resources include Human 
Network Characterstics, Feedback loops to identify the changing
crowd environment, and meeting quality gaurantees.

As well, several scheduling algorithms were used to
compare how well the framework performed in a simulation
environments.  Results seem to indicate that the Metric Enhanced
scheduling algorithm as simulation on their framework
performed best compared to other algorithms.
