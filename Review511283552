Main Idea
This paper claims that latency and packet loss only have
a 15% impact on download completion time.  This result is
then used as evidence that such a marginal impact proves
that experiments on cluster are valid results and the latecy
and packet loss measurements are not very relevant.

So they create a simulated network environment with network 
latency and packet loss ability.  Then several experiments are
run to see how they effect the download complete time metric.

The bittorrent setup is a private torrent one tracker with
 300 peers.

Two experiment scenarios are used to test the system.
1. The first scenario is simply to gain some insight into how
latency can effect download completion time. So latency was 
statically set between peers.
2. the second experiment groups peers into groups of haveing
equal network latency.  The groups latency is greater than
the intra-group latency.

it is key to remeber that bittorrent clients can control their
upload and download speeds using limits.  limits translated
to TCP in how fast the tcp session between peers sends 
data.
----------------------------------------------------------------
From a more technical perspective, the main issue is that 
bittorrent relies on TCP.  And the TCP protocol is somewhat 
dependant on latency and packet loss.  In particular, its the TCP 
ramp up function which increases the TCP data rate if all is well,
and decreases the TCP data rate if all is not well.  

Control messages exchanged between bittorrent clients
as well have an effect of which latency and packet loss are
relevent to.

The key metric used to measure the effect of latency and packet loss
for bittorrent clients is the download completion time metric.
What needs to be determined is how latency and packet loss
effect the download completion time.
