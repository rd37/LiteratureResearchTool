1. To determine Average Packet Flow rate using Packet sniffer.
- EWMA exponential weighted moving average.
Ai+1=(1-a)Ai+aIi
2. Skype uses iSAC coded by GlobalIP.ISAC can dynamically
change bit codec size and packet length of packets.
3. Manzel Hanzel test to determine  whether two functions are
statisically equivelant.
4.-Use of Regression analysis to model call duration taking 
into account several QoS factos, using Cox Model rather than 
linear-regression.
5. Cox Model: proportional hazards mdoel.
