What is new Idea? Is idea reasonalbe 
based on their assumptions?

Does this main idea make sense?
Main idea for the paper is to develop a better model of 
User satisfaction targeted for Skype.
-they propose a perceptual index for measing skype user
 satisfaction. Model is called USI and is based on call
duration and network QoS metrics. - is geared to skype
this idea uses passive measurement link ping pong
probing to get info. from skype call. 
- Params are easy to compute from measurements. 
- the compuation is the first and second moments 
of the packet counting process.



Is this idea better?
Compared to 9-11 it is a much better idea I think rather than
trying to measure voise noise.  much simplier to simply
measure the network packet rate since voise degradation
will be based on this anyway.

Is there proof that idea is better?

Is proof reproducable and resonable?

Is the process logic used for assessment good?
-The assessment started by comparing the proposed USI
model with an independant set of metrics that measure
voice interactivity from skype sessions.
-the assumption is that the more smoothly users interact,
the better the call.
-they used a wavelet based algorithm to measure 
skype session interactivity.
-they claim that the USI has a strong correlation to the 
wavelet algorithm thereby validating their model. However 
I see no proof of this in the paper. see section 5 ron.
-possible issue with network latency 1%

What is impact of this paper?  
-Impact of paper seems to state the obvious that better network
path as selected by peer to peer overlay will improve
Skype Session QoS.
