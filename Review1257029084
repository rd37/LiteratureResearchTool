Locality-Sensity-Hashing is fairly new in the last decade.
It is proposed for high dimensional searching which the number
of dimensions can range from 10 to thousands of dimensions.
it is probabilistic in its results.
It is proposes as better than using kd-trees or tree-like space
partitioning schemes.
2-3 dimensional spacing solutions are well solved for.
