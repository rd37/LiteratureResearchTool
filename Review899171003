I have concern that they claim a uTP client is equally valid 
as a TCP based client.  They maybe correct, but no work
was sites at describing the differences and how that may 
effect the results.

There is a claim in section II that users upload between 10 to 
100 KBs which they set manually.  Then they claim that this proves
that publich torrents are less than 100kBS.  This is a very 
confusing statement.  If they set the limit, how does this show
that it represents the real world?

An issue to me is that the latency and loss is per client, but it
should be between client pairs.  And since there are more
than likely many pairs, then this is an issue with their experiment
setup.

An issue with the iPlane measurments of how to emulate loss
and latency over the internet.  There reference is to a website with
three paper.  But it was not clear where they get the numbers
from exactly.

Unlcear if there is an issue of proving a cluster is good enough
to run an experiment when the experiment itself is done on 
a cluster.

Unlcear if leachers using the loop back (even with NetEm to emulate loss) is
good enough.  As well, it is unlikely that all clients stay
with a torrent untill all leachers have completed as described in 
part II section C of the the experiment description.

Main weakness I see is again the assumption of RTT of 400ms 
or less as reasonable.?

This research assumes perfect users as well.  I think more
studdy is needed.
