Paper is a bit weak in describing the simulation setup. 
More study on how tasks are correlated to each other is 
probably necessary.  As well there was no description on
task or client inter-arrival or crowd resource  inter-arrival or 
inter-departing times from the  system was discussed.  I
think statistical adding and remvoing of resources from
the crowd pool would be interesting.-however these issues
could easily be considered future works
