Problem
This paper attempts to determine if bittorrent experiments 
provide a good plateform that accurately respresent true
bittorrent performance.  the key issue is that in reality
bittorrent client downloads and uploads will suffer from
internet latency and internet packet loss.  since these two
issues are not relevent in a closed isolated cluster, it is
reasonable to question if bittorrent experiements on clusters
are an accurate representation.
