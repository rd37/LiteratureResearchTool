Experimentation
Several network topologies were used to run a simulation 
.

excellent use of doing both simulation and test bed evaluations
of splitstream.

Works as expected as used to describe the results is validated. I think.

Use of planet lab to verify the simulation is major point to
validation of this paper.  Everything was well described in detail
as far as results from the simulationl.
