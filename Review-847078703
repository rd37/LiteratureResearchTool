Summary
Tapestry provides a peer-to-peer overaly routing infrastructure.
Tapestry support use of virtualization so as to support web 
application deployment and management.  Since web apps
have varying resource demands and have mobile users, it
would be useful to have an overlay so the webapp developer
can ignore the network and deployment strategies and rely
on the the overlay to manage the resource requirements of 
the application.  This frees the devleoper to focus on applicatioin
specifics which benefit the users.

So application deployments physical location is knownn only
to tapestry, and no the clients that use the application.  This
level of indirection frees clients from the application so the
application can be moved or have its resources changed with
no noticeable effect from the users perspective.
