Did they miss something?
-Missing though that call lenght means good conversation.
Maybe longer call means poorer conversion since it takes 
longer to tranfer ideas to other party.
-They should have done a user study under varying conditions
to specify types of skype user and record their experiences.

Can we suggest improvement?


Can we proove improvement?
I think improvement has been proved due to extensive correlation
studies.
