Not clear how realistic the idea is that an algorithm can group
users into ISP. ? each peer sends states to trace servers every 
5 mins.  does this have an effect of results? not explained.
-they identify the streaming servers as a bottleneck, because 
UUSee optimization takes best advantage of the peers in the
system.  They isolate a single instance where this was quite
true, but one instance is not enough to claim that the algorithms
used to manage the peers are not themselves subject to
improvement.  
-some issues with math notation describing the 
problem formulation.
-conclusion could iterate over a few of the success such as 
using ration, there is more ISP traffic and less streaming server
traffic.  Which meets objective of the paper.
