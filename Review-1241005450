Tapestry
Networing API is very well described in this paper.  It teaches
you as well.  very good part II

Good experiment description and I like that they test parameters
seperately to get an idea of how each metric is effected.
for example, they isolate nodes from the network to just
test they processing ability by putting nodes on same machine
.
