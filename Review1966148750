Chapter 9 Graph Algorithms
choice of datastructure and algorithm greatly impact 
performance.

notes
-Directed Acyclic Graphs have no cycles.  
-a graph is connected if each Vertice has a path to
every other vectice.  
-if graph is directed, then is is called 
strongly connected. 
-if graph is not connected, but underlying graph without 
direction is connected, then graph is called weakly connected
-if every vertice is connected to every other vertice, then 
the graph is called a complete graph

a simple datastructure to represent the graph is a two dimensional
array of the vertices with T/F if edge is present.

dykstras algorithm is a greedy algorithm see page 309

Acyclic graphs and dykstras algorithm and critical path analysis
pg 311.

Network Flow Problems pg 314 using Graph Algs
OK

Minimum spanning tree pg 319
give the lowest cost to keep graph connected

Prims Algorithm pg 320
same as dykstras exept for finding minimum to maintain
connectivity

Kruskals algorithm pg 323
effectively builds a forest

A biconnected graph is a graph in which a node can be
removed and the remaining veritices remain connected.
pg 327

NPCompleteness-pg337
-if a problem is claimed to be NP-complete, then it must 
be shown to map to NP.  
-a NP problem can be solved in Polynomial time by
a non-determinsitic machine.
