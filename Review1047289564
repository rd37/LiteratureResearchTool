The main idea is to provide dynamically allocated bandwidth
to the servers as requried by their channels.  This is done by
changing the channels bandwidth requirement due to a
projection determined using a novel new on-line algorithm
which takes into account, number of peers, streaming quality,
and channel priority.

The goal of P2P is of course to elleviate stress on the streaming
server.  So the focus of this paper is not on the P2P, but on 
how to provision for the streaming server efficiently.

The algorithm understands the ISP to keep P2P within an
ISP.

 Paper using an algorithm called Ration to provision
bandwidth to the streaming server.  Ration will find the 
minimum  server capacity within an ISP to divi-up the
 capacity amung the channels.

Each streaming server is setup with the Ration algorithm.

Experiment is to deploy algorithm and measure real world
traces which are then replayed in a cluster.

Peers contribute in the system by continously estimating 
their upload capacity.  If its sending is lower than upload, then
more connections are requested by server.
