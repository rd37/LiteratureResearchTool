Excellent Paper.  This paper make good use of the PCM
modelling work to describe the performance of systems 
during offline evaluation and uses it in a proposed self-
adaptive achitecture to make resource changes during
runtime to save on resource usage, but still acheive 
quality of service requirements.  The proposed performance
architecture model and process along with a push pull type
algorithm appeared to acheive some resource savings.  
The SPECjEnterprise2010 bench mark was used to see
how well the self adaptive system performed and how much
resources it needed to get through the specs workload.  In some 
cases, up to 40% savings were detected by using the
proposed self-adaptive system.
