The primary data structure used and analysed in this paper 
was the tree-based multicast system.

see wikipedia document
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicast

Mulitcase means that the source sends a message to all
interested parties in a single transmission.  the message needs 
to be copied along the way.

SplitStream used a structrued peer to peer system. In this case
this was CAN,CHORD,PASTRY and TAPESTRY.

MDC is used to encode video so if peices are missing, the
quality of video presented is simply degraded.

Properties of Forest Construction Algorithms
first condition of feasible tree:
there is a simple check for forest construction feasibility.
that the sum of nodes in degree is less than the sum of 
all the nodes outbound requirement (num of children)

Pastry-splitstream uses pastry  and scribe  for overlay 

Pastry Review:
Pastry is a structured p2p overlay.  In pastry nodes and objects
have keys.  nodes contain objects.  if you have a message 
and a key, the message routes through the nodes till it
finds the node incharge of the object.  the nodeID and key 
ID will be close.  the closes node to a key is the keys objects 
root node.  

this low level capability can support DHT's or application 
layer communication (such as scribe).  The average Pastry 
delay is less than twice the IP delay from source to destination.

Scribe Review:
is a way to maintian disjoint trees.  Each scribe tree is a k peice
of the message.
