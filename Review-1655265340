Did they miss something?
-Model is specific for skype.  so conclusions must be targeted 
with this in mind.  they must now be careful not to 
generalize their results.
-Only really evaluated 3 papers on that use speech. 9-11.
-they claim that the USI has a strong correlation to the 
wavelet algorithm thereby validating their model. However 
I see no proof of this in the paper. -see section 5 ron
-still not completely convinced that length of call duration is 
completely depandant on bit rate.  although agreed that there 
is some correlation. not clear how high of a correlation.
-why 15pkt/sec threshold for EWMA?
-no user study done.  may be better than synthesized speech.

Are there holes in their agrument?
