Paper clearly describes what it is not focusing on.  For example,
most papers deal with which topology should be used, or 
incentive based participation, or how to deal with peer churn.  This
paper focuses on the streaming server itself.
-Good description of the tech used.  ie. ration provisioning 
algorithm.
-provides support for why this is a problem and that ISP
can benefit.  In particular, ISP's pay for inter-ISP traffic.  Therefore
in a P2P system.  It is beneficial for ISP that peers groups 
are all from a single ISP.

Interesting design for dynamic learning to estimate the 
stream quality. qc

Good use of work load (traces) to evaluate experiment.  Not 
clear if issues with one server per ISP.
