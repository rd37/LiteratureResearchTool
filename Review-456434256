What is problem to solve?
The fundemental question is whether skype is providning
 a goodenough voice phone service to the users or is there
 still room for improvement

Is problem Important?
It is important because 85 million users use skype.

How was problem attempted before?
Paper states that no formal study has been made to 
determine user satisfaction.  partially due to no model, and
due to the peer to peer nature of skype that makes it difficult to
capture traffic for modelling puroposes.

why previous solutions not sufficient?
other solution use signal distortion to determine the 
Quality of Communication as in [9]-ITU-T,[10]-LCL96
[11]-BBH01.  draw back is it requires signals from both ends of 
skype connection.  as well, it only uses speech to deter.
QoS.
